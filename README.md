A message to my children long after I am gone
I love you forever. You will always feel my love supporting you, even when I am not there to tell you.
Your mother and I have taught you our values and provided you the foundation to make your own decisions.
We are extremely proud of both of you. Every parents dream is to have their children be their greatest contribution to future generations and our hope is for you to achieve everything you dream. You have already fulfilled our dreams and we kvell (enjoy) every new experience you have.
